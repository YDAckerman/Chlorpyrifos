##______________________Intro_____________________________##
## We have amassed data from 114 pesticide efficacy studies in
## order to quantify and compare efficacy of individual
## active ingredients. The studies took
## place across 12 states (CA, AR, OK, TX, OH, KS, WA, AZ, MD,
## LA, FL, and VA) and together
## tested approximately 354 different products, which themselves
## used a combination of 1, 2, or 3 different active
## ingredients out of 141 total tested.

## The variation in effect between active ingredients
## is now our main interest, however measuring it is not straightforward.
## In order to compare trial's effects across trials and across studies, we
## needed a way to quantify in a single number the effectiveness of that trial.
## Towards this goal, we first calculated insect days, or the area
## under the study-long curve of insect density. We could then divide each
## trial's insect-day count by that of the experimental control, giving us a
## ratio describing the percent decrease in insect days in the trial versus
## the control. Finally, in order to achieve some degree of distributional
## normality, we took the natural log of this ratio. In our final effect,
## negative values suggest a trail that reduced the overall insect-day count,
## a value of 0 means there was no difference between that trial and the control,
## and a positive value means that trial experience more insect-days than the
## control.

## Of the 114 studies, 73 contained the necessary information to calculate
## 'insect days', and hence the overall effect, for each pesticide trial. 

## Furthermore, variation in this sample effect
## is complicated by variations in: the pest targeted (of 53 species);
## the rate at which the pesticide was applied; the adjuvant/surfactant
## combined with the pesticide; the location of the trial to name a few.
## In addition, study quality is a potentially confounding factor.
## Of the individual experiments reported (176),
## 44 did not report a measure of standard
## error, 8 reported an SEM, and 124 reported statistical groups from which we
## could deduce a lower and/or upper bound of the SEM. These we will use to
## form weights in our anova (or, should we include rate as a variable,
## regression).

## We are also exploring other measures of study quality based on our knowledge
## of the experiments structure. These include measuring the slope of the insect
## density curve in the experiment's control, the variation in the control, and the
## sample size (when given) of each experiment.
## We hope these statistics will paint a picture
